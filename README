UDPM version 0.75
=================

If you write end-user interactive programs with Perl and need
a quick-and-dirty interface for interaction while maintaining
platform (semi-)independance then this is for you.

UserDialogPerlModule is simply an OOPerl wrapper for the dialog
application(s). This version of UDPM supports dialog, cdialog
(aka: dialog ver. 0.9b), whiptail, gdialog and kdialog. There
is also an ASCII dialog mode (as a fallback for systems without
a dialog variant).
